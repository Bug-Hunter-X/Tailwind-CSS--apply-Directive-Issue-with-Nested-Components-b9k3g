# Tailwind CSS @apply Directive Issue with Nested Components

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive within nested components.  The issue arises because styles applied within an inner component may not correctly propagate to the parent component, leading to unexpected visual results such as missing styles or styling inconsistencies.

**Problem:** Styles defined using `@apply` within an inner component may not be applied correctly when the inner component is nested within a parent component. This results in inconsistent styling in the parent component, even when the styles are correctly defined in the child component.

**Solution:**  Refactor the component to directly apply the styles within the parent component. Alternatively, investigate the usage of `@apply` carefully, making sure the order of your classes and directives is correct. Consider alternatives to `@apply` like directly including the utility classes or creating a reusable custom style class for the parent component.
