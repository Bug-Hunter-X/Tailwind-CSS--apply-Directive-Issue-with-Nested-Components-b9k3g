This error occurs when using Tailwind CSS with `@apply` directives inside of a component that is then included within another component. The inner component's styles may not be applied correctly, resulting in unexpected visual outcomes. This often manifests as missing styles or incorrect styling in the parent component, despite the styles being correctly defined in the inner component.
